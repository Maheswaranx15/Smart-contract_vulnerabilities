## Unencrypted Private Data On-Chain

Ethereum smart contract code, storage, and any data transacted on-chain can always be read. Treat it as such. Even if your code is not verified on Etherscan, attackers can still decompile or check transactions to and from it to analyze it. For this reason, it's imperative that private data is never stored on-chain unencrypted.
