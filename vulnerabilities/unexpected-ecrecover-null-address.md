## Unexpected `ecrecover` Null Address

`ecrecover` is a precompiled built-in cryptographic function which recovers an address associated with the public key from an elliptic curve signature or *returns zero on error*. The parameters corresponding to the signature are `r`, `s` & `v`.

As noted above, `ecrecover` will return zero on error. It's possible to do this deterministically by setting `v` as any positive number other than 27 or 28.

`ecrecover` is often used to verify that the signer is an authorized account. The problem with this is that uninitialized or renounced authorization logic often sets the owner/admin address as `address(0)`, the same value which may be deterministically returned by `ecrecover`. This means that an unsecure contract may allow an attacker to spoof an authorized-only method into executing as though the authorized account is the signer.

```
// UNSECURE
function setOwner(bytes32 newOwner, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external {
	address signer = ecrecover(newOwner, v, r, s);
	require(signer == owner);
	owner = address(newOwner);
}
```

The above method is intended to only set a new `owner` if a valid signature from the existing `owner` is provided. However, as we know, if we set `v` to any value other than 27 or 28, the `signer` will be the null address and if the current owner is uninitialized or renounced, the `require` statement will succeed allowing an attacker to set themselves as `owner`.

We can mitigate this issue by reverting if the recovered `signer` address is null, e.g.:

```
function setOwner(bytes32 newOwner, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external {
	address signer = ecrecover(newOwnerHash, v, r, s);
	require(signer == owner && signer != address(0));
	owner = address(newOwner);
}
```
